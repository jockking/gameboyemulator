# Building a Gameboy emulator from sratch

I've been keen to learn how machine emulation works.  After considering which platform to try and emulate, i decided to try the original Gameboy.  This project is my attempt to learn.

Key steps

1) Decide upon which language to write the emulator in
2) Code out the CPU and memory emulation
3) CPU timing
4) Graphics GPU emulation
5) Sounds
5) Subsystem events
  - Joypad
  - timer
  - DMA
  - Sprites
  - interrupts
